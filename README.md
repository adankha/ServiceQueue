# Service Queue
Author: Ashour Dankha

Class: CS 251 Data Structures, Spring 2015

This program has two parts that uses the Linked List ADT( https://github.com/adankha/Linked-Lists ).

The first part works with qsort and msort (quicksort and mergesort). The simple program reads from stdin and sorts the values using the different sort methods.

The second part works with a Service Queue which also uses the ADT Linked List from above.

The implementation of the ADT helps support management of a restaurant queue. The program consists of multiple commands that help a restaurant take reservations and seat individuals.

Moreover, the Service Queue also has expected and efficient run-time requirements to help with time efficienies for sufficiently large service queues.
